            "LLM Variants and Meta's Open Source Before shedding light on four major trends, I'd share the latest Meta's Llama 2 and Code Llama. Meta's Llama 2 represents a sophisticated evolution in LLMs. This suite spans models pretrained and fine-tuned across a parameter spectrum of 7 billion to 70 billion. A specialized derivative, Llama 2-Chat, has been engineered explicitly for dialogue-centric applications. Benchmarking revealed Llama 2's superior performance over most extant open-source chat models. Human-centric evaluations, focusing on safety and utility metrics, positioned Llama 2-Chat as a potential contender against proprietary, closed-source counterparts. The development trajectory of Llama 2 emphasized rigorous fine-tuning methodologies. Meta's transparent delineation of these processes aims to catalyze community-driven advancements in LLMs, underscoring a commitment to collaborative and responsible AI development. Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models: Code Llama, the foundational code model;Codel Llama - Python specialized for Python;and Code Llama - Instruct, which is fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions. Based on its benchmark testing, Code Llama outperformed state-of-the-art publicly available LLMs (except GPT-4) on code tasks. Llama 2, Llama 2-Chat, and Code Llama are key steps in LLM development but still have a way to go compared to GPT-4. Meta's open access and commitment to improving these models promise transparent and faster LLM progress in the future. Please refer to the LLM and Llama variants below:  From LLMs to Multimodal LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), primarily focus on understanding and generating human language. They've been instrumental in tasks like text generation, translation, and even creative writing. However, their scope is limited to text. Enter multimodal models like GPT-4. These are a new breed of AI models that can understand and generate not just text, but also images, sounds, and potentially other types of data. The term \"multimodal\" refers to their ability to process multiple modes or types of data simultaneously. This is a game-changer. Imagine an AI that can not only read a description of a dress but also visualize it or even design it! Multimodal AI models are moving us towards more holistic AI systems. These systems can potentially understand our world in a more comprehensive manner, bridging the gap between different forms of data and providing richer, more integrated solutions. As we stand on the cusp of this new era, it's exciting to envision the myriad of applications and innovations that Multimodal models will bring to the table. The future of AI looks more integrated and versatile than ever before.  From Connections to Vector DB The AI landscape is witnessing a fascinating transition: from Language Model (LLM) connections or integrations, e.g., LangChain and LlamaIndex, to the rise of Vector Databases (Vector DB) such as Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, Chroma, and Vespa.ai. But what's driving this shift, and why does it matter? LLM connections, like the LlamaIndex, primarily focus on linking and understanding vast amounts of external data. They've been pivotal in creating semantic connections, enabling more intuitive search experiences, and enhancing data accessibility. However, as the volume and variety of data grow, the need for more advanced storage and retrieval mechanisms becomes evident. This is where Vector DBs come into play. Unlike traditional databases that store data in rows and columns, Vector DBs store data in high-dimensional space, allowing for more efficient and accurate similarity searches. Tools like Weaviate and Milvus are designed to handle massive datasets, making them ideal for tasks like image recognition, recommendation systems, and more. The rise of Vector DBs represents a broader trend in AI: the quest for more efficient, scalable, and versatile data handling solutions. As we navigate this evolution, it's clear that the combination of LLMs and Vector DBs will redefine how we store, access, and understand data in the AI-driven future.  From Agents to OS The AI realm is abuzz with innovations, and one of the most intriguing shifts we're witnessing is the transition from LLM agents to using LLMs as Operating Systems (OS). Let's delve into this evolution and its implications. LLM agents, like AutoGPT, AgentGPT, BabyAGI, and HuggingGPT, have been groundbreaking in automating tasks based on user requests. These agents leverage the power of Language Models (LLMs) to understand and execute commands, making them invaluable in tasks ranging from content generation to data analysis. Their adaptability and intelligence have made them a staple in many AI toolkits. However, the vision for AI doesn't stop there. The concept of LLM as an OS is emerging as the next big thing. Imagine an operating system where the core is a language model, orchestrating everything around it. Such a system would not just execute tasks but would understand context, anticipate needs, and offer solutions in real time. It's like turning the LLM into the brain of the digital ecosystem, making devices and applications more intuitive and responsive than ever. The move towards LLM as OS signifies a paradigm shift in how we perceive and utilize AI. It's not just about automation anymore; it's about creating a seamless, intelligent interface between humans and technology. As we stand on the brink of this transformation, the potential for LLM-driven OS to revolutionize our digital interactions is immense.  From Fine-tuning to Plugins The world of LLMs is undergoing a transformative shift, moving from intricate fine-tuning processes to the more dynamic realm of plugins. Let's unpack this evolution. Historically, fine-tuning has been the cornerstone of LLM optimization. There are two primary ways to fine-tune LLMs: feeding data into the LLM in real-time and directly fine-tuning on the LLM. From a technical standpoint, this involves three methods: Transfer Learning: Adapting a pre-trained model to new tasks.Sequential Fine-tuning: Refining models in stages for specific tasks.Task-specific Fine-tuning: Tailoring models for a particular function. Moreover, LLM techniques like In-context learning, Few-shot learning, and Zero-shot learning have further enhanced the model's adaptability, allowing them to understand and generate content with minimal data. However, the future of LLMs is leaning towards plugins. With the introduction of tools like GPT-4 Plugins, the focus is on extending LLMs seamlessly. Instead of running LLMs as a service, they're envisioned as platforms. This means integrating LLMs with various tools, enhancing their capabilities, and offering a more modular and scalable approach to AI applications. The journey from fine-tuning to plugins represents a move from static optimization to dynamic adaptability, ensuring that LLMs remain at the forefront of AI innovation.  In a Nutshell The AI domain is witnessing rapid shifts, with LLMs playing a central role. Initially, the move was from LLMs to Multimodal models, expanding from text to include images and sounds. Simultaneously, the trend shifted from LLM connections, which linked external data, to Vector Databases for efficient high-dimensional storage. Another evolution saw LLM agents, which automated tasks, transitioning towards LLMs as Operating Systems. This change aims for more intuitive, context-aware devices and applications. Furthermore, the traditional fine-tuning processes of LLMs are now being replaced by dynamic plugins, turning LLMs into platforms integrated with various tools. Leading this LLM revolution are OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA2. Their pioneering efforts are setting the stage for an AI future that's more integrated, responsive, and attuned to human interactions.

            "Text\t only fine-tuning a small number of additional parameters, with virtually all model parameters remaining frozen. PEFT has been found to produce good generalization with relatively low-volume datasets. Furthermore, it enhances the reusability and portability of the model, as the small checkpoints obtained can be easily added to the base model, and the base model can be easily fine-tuned and reused in multiple scenarios by adding the PEFT parameters. Finally, since the base model is not adjusted, all the knowledge acquired in the pre-training phase is preserved, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Most widely used PEFT techniques aim to keep the pre-trained base model untouched and add new layers or parameters on top of it. These layers are called \"Adapters\" and the technique of their adjustment \"adapter-tuning\", we add these layers to the pre-trained base model and only train the parameters of these new layers. However, a serious problem with this approach is that these layers lead to increased latency in the inference phase, which makes the process inefficient in many scenarios.In the LoRa technique, a Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models, the idea is not to include new layers but to add values to the parameters in a way that avoids this scary problem of latency in the inference phase. LoRa trains and stores the changes of the additional weights while freezing all the weights of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we train a new weights matrix with the changes in the pre-trained model matrix, and this new matrix is decomposed into 2 Low-rank matrices as explained here:  Merge the base model and the adapter weights As we mention, we have trained \"modification weights\" on the base model, our final model requires merging the pretrained model and the adapters in a single model. You can find and download the model in my Hugging Face account edumunozsala/llama-27b-int4-python-code-20k. Give it a try!

Llama 2: Revolutionizing Commercial Use Unlike its predecessor Llama 1, which was limited to research use, Llama 2 represents a major advancement as an open-source commercial model. Businesses can now integrate Llama 2 into products to create AI-powered applications. Availability on Azure and AWS facilitates fine-tuning and adoption. However, restrictions apply to prevent exploitation. Companies with over 700 million active daily users cannot use Llama 2. Additionally, its output cannot be used to improve other language models.  II. Llama 2 Model Flavors Llama 2 is available in four different model sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, 34 billion, and 70 billion parameters. While 7B, 13B, and 70B have already been released, the 34B model is still awaited. The pretrained variant, trained on a whopping 2 trillion tokens, boasts a context window of 4096 tokens, twice the size of its predecessor Llama 1. Meta also released a Llama 2 fine-tuned model for chat applications that was trained on over 1 million human annotations. Such extensive training comes at a cost, with the 70B model taking a staggering 1720320 GPU hours to train. The context window's length determines the amount of content the model can process at once, making Llama 2 a powerful language model in terms of scale and efficiency.  III. Safety Considerations: A Top Priority for Meta Meta's commitment to safety and alignment shines through in Llama 2's design. The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving\n",

            "Text\t ready to run locally. Please see a few snapshots below: Similar to ChatGPT, GPT4All has the ability to comprehend Chinese, a feature that Bard lacks. If you want to interact with GPT4All programmatically, you can install the nomic client as follows. Install the nomic client using pip install nomic.Use the following Python script to interact with GPT4All:  Chat4All Demystified GPT4All aims to provide a cost-effective and fine-tuned model for high-quality LLM results. The GPT4All model was fine-tuned using an instance of LLaMA 7B with LoRA on 437,605 post-processed examples for 4 epochs. Detailed model hyperparameters and training codes can be found in the GitHub repository. GPT4All developers collected about 1 million prompt responses using the GPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI API from various publicly available datasets. After an extensive data preparation process, they narrowed the dataset down to a final subset of 437,605 high-quality prompt-response pairs. Developing GPT4All took approximately four days and incurred $800 in GPU expenses and $500 in OpenAI API fees. The final gpt4all-lora model can be trained on a Lambda Labs DGX A100 8x 80GB in about 8 hours, with a total cost of $100. A preliminary evaluation of GPT4All compared its perplexity with the best publicly known alpaca-lora model. Results showed that the fine-tuned GPT4All models exhibited lower perplexity in the self-instruct evaluation compared to Alpaca. However, this assessment was not exhaustive due to encouraging users to run the model on local CPUs to gain qualitative insights into its capabilities.  TL;DR Considering the expensive LLMs in training and serving, Meta LLaMA is a foundation for accelerating LLM open-source community. Stanford's Alpaca, based on LLaMA, offers an optimized smaller model with enhanced performance. Now, GPT4All, also built on LLaMA, enables local execution. Generative AI is evolving rapidly every day. Thanks to Brandon Duderstadt for reviewing this article.\n",

Problems with hallucinations remain (Bordor, Lila characters who are not in the story). The LLama2 13B 4-bit fine-tuned model has better output than the 7B model. A lot more needs to be explored in Fine-tuning. One observation is that slight changes in prompts give different answers. Since the output is not deterministic (that is, with even the same prompt, it varies over time), it is all the more difficult to fine-tune prompts to give the most effective output. This needs to be studied more. Also to be updated are higher level use-cases that should be possible with the fine-tuned models.\n",
